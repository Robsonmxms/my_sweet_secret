My Sweet Secret is an indie psychological horror game in which John, a young adult, begins to hallucinate a boy and discover files in his house that refer to a psychiatric past he doesn't remember. John embarks on a journey to discover the truth as he mixes reality with hallucination and children continue to disappear in his town. Nobody believes in John, not even him sometimes, would you believe him?
